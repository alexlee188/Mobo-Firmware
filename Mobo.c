//** Acknowledgements: The Mobo code is a further development of the firmware
//**                   initially developed for the ATtiny45 by Thomas Baier, DG8SAQ,
//**                   and then much refined by F.W. Krom, PE0FKO.
//**                   The code, although bloated up to about four times its original
//**                   size to cater for the functions needed for a "full featured"
//**                   SDR transceiver, still retains the original command
//**                   structure and is compatible with V 15.12 of the PE0FKO code.

//**                   Functionality highlights description:
//**
//**                    1) Control of the Si570 Programmable Crystal Oscillator,
//**                       including "smoothtune" for seamless tuning between small
//**					   frequency steps (<3500ppm)
//**                    2) Variable speed VFO, using a rotary encoder, and 9 short/long term memories,
//**                       using a pushbutton (cycle with short pushes, store with long)
//**					3) Accomodate different Encoder Resolutions (PPT) through a User command
//**                    4) CW Paddle inputs
//**                    5) PTT output
//**                    6) PTT2 output (connected to SWR protect function)
//**                    7) Automatic selection between 8 Bandpass filters,
//**                       with user selectable switchpoints
//**                    8) Automatic selection between [Default] 8 or 16 Lowpass filters, with user
//**                       selectable switchpoints, by controlling 2x external PCF8574 8 bit GPIO extenders.
//**                       Alternately, it can also provide direct control of 4 to 8 Lowpass filters
//**                       through a 3 bit directly connected GPIO
//**                       port  (Mobo 4.3 P1 pins 4-6).
//**                    9) Measurement of Input voltage, PA current, Power forward and Power refleced 
//**                       (uses external Power/SWR bridge)
//**                   10) Hi-SWR protect function, when using an external Power/SWR bridge
//**                       (automatically lower PA bias and assert an external signal)
//**                   11) PEP indication for power output, shows the highest measured value within a
//**                       user adjustable time window of up to 2 seconds (10 samples per second).
//**                   12) Power Amplifier (PA) Temperature measurement and automatic Transmit Disable
//**                       on a high temperature condition
//**                   13) Cooling FAN control, using two temperature trigger settings, one for on and
//**                       another one for off.
//**                   14) Manual PA Bias setpoint control, switching between different bias setpoints
//**                       (such as between classes A and AB), and automatic calibration of the
//**                       PA bias current
//**                   15) 20x4 or 40x2 LCD display with analog-style bargraphs for enhanced power output 
//**                       and SWR visualisation.
//**                   16) optional 16x2 and 20x2 LCD display alternatives with analog-style bargraphs for
//**                       power output and SWR visualisation.
//**                   17) an alternative optional 16x2 LCD display without the bargraphs, providing Frequency
//**                       readout, Power/SWR metering and status diplay (RX/TX/hi-SWR/hi-TMP/Mem-store...)
//**                   18) LCD frequency display offset option, for readout of the actual transmit/receive
//**                       frequency, when using PowerSDR-IQ
//**                   19) Read/Write a byte from/to external I2C connected General Purpose IO extenders
//**                       PCF8574 (filters, attenuators, amplifiers)

//**                    Power Bargraph now works for values higher than 15W.

//**                    Option for direct control of PCF8574 now disabled by default.

//**                    Default PEP window set back to 10 (1 second window).
//**                    Added a new #define to reverse the Rotary Encoder VFO direction.
//**                    Code cleanup to free a few hundred bytes (particularly PCF8574 I2C routines).
//**                    Option for TX filter controls on the CPU PortD now disabled.  If the user needs

//**                    PCF_FILTER_IO or M0RZF_FILTER_IO LPF options described below. 
//**                    Added a new #define PCF_FILTER_IO to support switching of up to 8 low pass
//**                    filters through the 3 previously unused bits on the onboard PCF8574 chip.
//**                    Added a new #define M0RZF_FILTER_IO to support low pass filter switching on the

//**                    Code for Command 0x43 partially in place, to support modification of
//**                    the USB Serial Number descriptor.  However, this is not fully
//**                    implemented, due to lack of pgm space (RAM) resources.
